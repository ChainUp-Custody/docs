## WAPI

This document is used by the third-party technical team **to add the self-developed** main chain to the ChainUp Custody for alliance members.

Please note that ChainUp Custody cannot be held responsible for the security of assets when third-party technical teams use **WAPI** to access the server and hold private keys. As such, it is the responsibility of the third-party technical team to establish a complete wallet private key and API private key custody system.
