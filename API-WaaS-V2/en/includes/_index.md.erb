# Docking Solutions

To allow customers more convenient and quicker access to Custody service, our platform has a comprehensive set of docking solutions based on previous clients’ requirement.

The whole program is divided into four processes:

1.Obtain the deposit address

2.User deposit

3.User withdrawl

4.Financial reconciliation

Note: If the client’s project timeline is urgent, the necessary processes [obtaining the deposit address], [user deposit], [user withdrawal], and [financial reconciliation] can be developed in two weeks.

## Obtain the deposit address

1）Customer registers with Custody system (email address is recommended)

2）After successful registration, the address can be obtained through the UID of the Custody system

Note: Obtaining the address in advance helps to ensure efficient address allocation after user registration; If the user registers and then obtains the address through the interface, it may fail due to reasons such as network issue, resulting in users’ inability to use the services.

[![../_images/api_tsoulution_zhunbei.png](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_zhunbei.png)](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_zhunbei.png)

## User deposit

1）The user completes registration in their system;

2）When the user checks the currency deposit address on the user interface, the system will assign a currency address to the user;

3）Users send coins to the address;

4）The Custody system monitors and accounts for the transaction of coins in the blockchain address on behalf of the clients, and notifies the client actively or automatically obtaining it within the system.

5）After the system confirms the validity of the information for coin deposit, the coins will be credited into the user’s account;

6）The system notifies the user that the coins are successfully deposited.

[![../_images/api_tsoulution_chongzhi.png](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_chongzhi.png)](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_chongzhi.png)

Note: The asynchronous callback of teh Custody system will be triggered when each order is final, and it can be sent up to 5 times per day;

Timed task: a total of five callbacks

Notification time: 1s for the first time, 2min for the second time, 8min for the third time, 32min for the fourth time, 128min for the fifth time

Callback logic：

If the callback is successful, update the callback status;

If the callback fails, continue the callback and update the interval between the next callback;

When the callback fails five times, the callback is stopped

## User withdrawal

1）The user initiates withdrawal in their system;

2）After the customer’s system has been approved, it will notify the Custody system;

3）The Custody system provides two withdrawal conformation to the customer system;

4）After the customer system confirms that the withdrawal information is valid, the Custody system verifies the withdrawal information, and then the payment is initiated;

5）The Custody system monitors the status of withdrawal orders, and actively notifies the client upon completion of withdrawal or actively acquires it by the customer system;

6）The customer system informs the user that the withdrawal is successful.

[![../_images/api_tsoulution_tibi.png](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_tibi.png)](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_tibi.png)

## Financial reconciliation

1）Perform checks on accounts between the customer system and Custody system periodically (daily is recommended)

2）At midnight the the next day, the system retrieves all the deposits and withdrawals for the previous day as well as the aggregated orders and collection of the miners’ fees

3）The customer system’s orders are reconciled against those in the Custody system

4）If the order quantity, amount and status are correct, the reconciliation will be successful; Otherwise contact Custody support to resolve the issue

[![../_images/api_tsoulution_duizhang.png](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_duizhang.png)](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/api_tsoulution_duizhang.png)

Note: In the Custody system, there are three kinds of cost expenses in the tripartite system: collecting miners’ fees, extracting miners’ fees, and profit-sharing commission;

1. Collection of Miners’ Fee: With each currency’s account type, after depositing the coins, the funds on the address will be collected to the hot wallet address and the blockchain network. Part of the main chain blockchain transaction will consume the miner fee and the cost of which will be borne by the client. The client can contact us if they would like this capital expenditure will be handled by us;
2. Miner’s fee: Miner’s fee (in some currencies) shall be borne by the three parties when withdrawing coins to the address of non-ChainUp Custody and using the blockchain network. This part of capital expenditure can be viewed directly in the coin withdrawal order;
3. Distribution fee: temporarily not charged.



# Preparation before development

## Development Notes

#### Two pairs of public and private key functions (API mode）

**The first pair of public and private keys**： The developer shall generate a pair of public and private keys in advance when opening the asset management account. The public key (rsa_third_pub) is provided to the platform and the private key is kept by itself. The private key is the only proof for the third-party application to call the wallet service and shall not be disclosed to anyone. When the third party requests the wallet service, the private key is used to encrypt the request parameters. When the platform receives the request, the public key (rsa_third_pub) is used to decrypt the request data.

**The second pair of public and private keys**： After the developer opens the asset management account, the platform will provide the wallet public key (rsa_wallet_pub) to the developer. When the third-party application receives the response data or asynchronous notification of the wallet, it needs to use the public key to decrypt.



#### Why is it necessary to confirm the withdrawal twice (API method)

When the wallet service receives a request from a third-party application, in confirm that the request is a legitimate request from a third-party application, it will call the interface provided by the third-party to confirm. To a certain extent, this process can avoid the influence caused by the loss of the third party’s private key, and also provides an effective barrier for the security of the wallet service.



#### Domain name and API key (API mode)

| Production domain name(test environment not supported): |    [https://openapi.hicoin.vip](https://openapi.hicoin.vip/)                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| app_id:                                                 | Please get it after creating the wallet                      |
| rsa_wallet_pub:                                         | Custody system public key; Please create the wallet and get it from the Custody system |
| rsa_third_prv:                                          | Client private key; Independent generation and preservation  |
| rsa_third_pub:                                          | Client public key; Autonomous generation; Please create the wallet and configure it to the Custody system |



**RSA public/private key generated address** http://www.metools.info/code/c80.html

Recommended password length：`2048`

Recommended key format：`PKCS#8`

Description：

1. Rsa_third_prv is a private key for third-party applications and is used primarily to encrypt request parameters. In a production environment, rsa_third_prv is generated by the developer and the corresponding public key is provided to the platform. To simplify the docking process for developers, a set of third-party public and private keys is directly provided here to facilitate quick docking for developers.
2. Test environment docking is not supported at present, please register to create a wallet according to **Access Guidelines** , and get the API related information of the production environment.



## Asset management account preparation

#### The developer prepares the following information：

1）Generate a pair of public and private keys and provide the public key to the platform;

2）IP of third-party application server;

3）Recharge withdrawal callback notification address;

4）Reconfirm the address for withdrawal;

5）Whether to enable the automatic collection function. After the function is enabled, the system will automatically transfer the user’s recharge funds to the merchant collection account.



Contact relevant personnel of the platform to provide the above five types of information. The platform prepares an asset management account for you and provides you with the following information:



1）Unique identification of the merchant：`app_id`；

2）The wallet public key：`rsa_wallet_pub`.

## Interface Interaction Process

Documentation is the interface that the wallet service provides to third-party applications.

[![../_images/apiopen-instructions.png](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/apiopen-instructions.png)](https://custodydocs.chainup.com/en/latest/_images/apiopen-instructions.png)

The interface providers in the following documents are referred to as **wallet services**，and the interface callers are referred to as **third-party applications**. When the third-party application requests the wallet service, it encrypts the request parameters through the RSA algorithm and decrypts the response data after receiving the wallet service



## Interface rules


| Transfer mode:               | https(HTTP is temporarily used in the test environment)      |
| :--------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Signature field:             | All Required fields, except the Sign field, need to be signed |
| The response status code is: | 0, indicating successful processing, and non-0 indicates request error or system exception |
| Request address:             | domain name + interface address                              |
| Encryption algorithm:        | See `Encryption and Decryption Mode` at **API doc** - Overview for details |

*Matters needing attention*
<br/>
<br/>
1. There are two symbols + and/that are escaped directly by URL in Base64 traditional encoding. Therefore, if we want to transfer these encoded strings through URL, we need to do traditional Base64 encoding first, then replace + and/with two characters - _ respectively, and do the opposite action decoding at the receiving end. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. RSA encryption and decryption using segmented encryption

If the withdrawal address is the internal address of the Alliance, it will not be linked; Otherwise, you need to chain up. In addition, in order to avoid illegal withdrawal requests, when the wallet service receives a withdrawal request from a third-party application, it will call the `Withdrawal Reconfirmation Interface` provided by the third party.
